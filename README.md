# BundleIDFetcher4iOS
BundleIDFetcher, now for iOS!

## What is this?
For those of you who have been following me know that I have a tool called BundleIDFetcher. This is essentially it's mobile counterpart, written in Objective-C and fully documented.

If you do not know about BundleIDFetcher, feel free to visit it [HERE](https://github.com/mass1ve-err0r/BundleIDFetcher). It's a tool written in C# to fetch AppIcons through the usage of iTunes' search API in 512x512.

(Also compatible with A12(X)/ arm64e, for those who wonder)

## How do I get it ??
The application **IS NOT** signed by me, so there's a couple of ways to obtain/ install this:

> Jailbroken -Guide:

Simply search for "BIDFetcher" inside your package manager of choice & install it.
The package is hosted on the Dynastic Repository.
Keep in mind this will *only work while in a jailbroken state.*
>Jailbroken -Guide variant 2: ReProvision

1. Get/ Download the IPA from [HERE](https://github.com/mass1ve-err0r/BundleIDFetcher4iOS/releases/tag/1.0)
2. Open it with ReProvision
3.  Profit??
> Non-Jailbroken Guide:

Since I don't supply a signed version, ask your favorite signing service to sign & host this.
Permission is hereby given, however do install at your own discretion.

## How does it work ?
Some basic ObjC knowledge will be required, however I have tried & documented the entire code from start to finish, so please read through it.

ObjC veterans will notice questionable design choices, however for the sake of understanding this is the way it is.

I encourage newcomers to read through & to do their own research in regards to the language & procedures.
